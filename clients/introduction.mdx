# Connecting with Clients

Toolrouter supports a variety of clients, from IDEs to custom applications. This guide will help you understand how to integrate Toolrouter with different client applications.

## Available Clients

Toolrouter officially supports these clients:

- [Claude](/clients/claude) - Anthropic's Claude integration
- [Cursor](/clients/cursor) - Cursor IDE integration
- [Windsurf](/clients/windsurf) - Windsurf editor integration
- [Cline](/clients/cline) - Command-line interface
- [VS Code](/clients/vscode) - Visual Studio Code extension
- [CoPilot](/clients/copilot) - GitHub Copilot integration


You will need to obtain SSE credentials to connect to any of these clients.

## How to obtain SSE credentials

On your created stack, click on the "Connect" tab and click on the "SSE Client for IDEs & Clients" button.

/>

Then click on the "Create SSE Credentials" button.

  alt="Create SSE Credentials"
  width="80%"
/>

Once you create the credentials, you will be able to see the credentials and the SSE endpoint.

You can copy the credentials and use them to connect to the client.

The Implementation tab will have the credentials and the SSE endpoint for the client you want to use.

You can also refresh or delete the credentials from this tab if needed.
